This is my implementation of an arithmetic system inspired by Harold Abelson
and Gerald Jay Sussman's system in Structure and Interpretation of Computer 
Programs.

To avoid creating a large function that calls the appropriate procedure for
operating on two given types, we built a "tower of types." This approach allows
us to easily use coercion to operate on different representations. By using
this method, we only need around n procedures, where n is the number of
representations. If we were to implement all conversion procedures 
individually, we would need close to n^2 procedures.

We are using a technique called data-directed programming, in which procedures
are stored in a tree-like structure, traversed to find the correct function for
operating on the relevant data. Each data type contains a tag, which is used to
find the appropriate procedure in the treeâ€”a technique known as tagged data.

The code is implemented in MIT Scheme, also known as the SICP Language. We
chose MIT Scheme instead of Scheme or Racket because we update the table where
procedures are stored using set-cdr!, a procedure no longer available in modern
Scheme versions. Although the usage of this procedure is not strictly
necessary, the functions can be updated to run in modern Scheme with minor
modifications, such as adding else clauses to some if statements.
